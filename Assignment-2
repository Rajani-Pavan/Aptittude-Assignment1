Aptitude Assignment 2

1.	What quantity of water should be added to the milk water mixture so that the milk water ratio changes from 2:3 to 4:11. The quantity of milk in the mixture is 40 litres

The current milk-water ratio is 2:3, which means that there is 2/5 = 40% milk in the mixture.
The desired milk-water ratio is 4:11, which means that there is 4/15 = 26.67% milk in the mixture.
To achieve this ratio, we need to add water until the milk content decreases to 26.67%.
The amount of water to be added is given by:

(40% - 26.67%) * Total volume = Amount of water to be added
13.33% * Total volume = Amount of water to be added
Amount of water to be added = 13.33% * 40 liters = 5.33 liters


Therefore, 5.33 liters of water should be added to the milk-water mixture to change the milk-water ratio from 2:3 to 4:11.
Here is a table showing the milk and water content in the mixture before and after adding water:
Before adding water	After adding water
Milk: 40 liters (80%)	Milk: 34.67 liters (73.33%)
Water: 20 liters (20%)	Water: 5.33 liters (26.67%)

2.	Linear equation 2x+3y=0 meets the x & y-axis at the point?

The linear equation 2x + 3y = 0 meets the x-axis when y = 0. Substituting y = 0 into the equation, we get 2x = 0, which means x = 0. Therefore, the point of intersection of the x-axis is (0, 0).
The linear equation 2x + 3y = 0 meets the y-axis when x = 0. Substituting x = 0 into the equation, we get 3y = 0, which means y = 0. Therefore, the point of intersection of the y-axis is (0, 0).
Therefore, the linear equation 2x + 3y = 0 meets the x & y-axis at the point (0, 0).
3.	a & b are positive integers such that a^2-b^=19. Find a & b?

Sure. Here are the possible values of a and b:

a = 10
b = 9

To solve for a and b, we can use the following steps:
1.	Factorize 19. We get 19 = 19 x 1.
2.	Find the two closest perfect squares that are less than or equal to 19. The two closest perfect squares are 9 and 16.
3.	Subtract the two perfect squares from 19. We get 19 - 9 = 10 and 19 - 16 = 3.
4.	The two numbers that satisfy the equation a^2 - b^2 = 19 are 10 and 9.

4.	Find a^+b^3+c^3+3 abc, where a+b+c=5 &, a^2+b^2+c^2=10?

Sure. We can use the following identity to solve for a^+b^3+c^3+3abc:

a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3abc = (a + b + c)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - ac - bc)
We know that a + b + c = 5 and a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 10. Substituting these values into the identity, we get:
a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3abc = (5)(10 - ab - ac - bc)
We can solve for ab + ac + bc using the following identity:
ab + ac + bc = (a + b + c)^2 - (a^2 + b^2 + c^2)
Substituting a + b + c = 5 and a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 10 into the identity, we get:
ab + ac + bc = (5)^2 - 10 = 25 - 10 = 15
Substituting ab + ac + bc = 15 into the first equation, we get:
a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3abc = (5)(10 - 15) = (5)(-5) = -25
Therefore, a^+b^3+c^3+3abc = -25.
5.	Sum of two, two-digit numbers is a perfect square. The digits of the first two-digit number are two consecutive positive integers; also, when the digits of the first number are reversed, the second number is formed. Find these numbers & the square root of their sum

The two numbers are 12 and 21, and the square root of their sum is 14.
To solve this problem, we can use the following steps:
1.	The first two-digit number is formed by two consecutive positive integers. The two consecutive positive integers that can be used to form a two-digit number are 1 and 2.
2.	The second number is formed by reversing the digits of the first number. The reversed digits of 12 are 21.
3.	The sum of the two numbers is 12 + 21 = 33.
4.	33 is a perfect square. The square root of 33 is 14.
Therefore, the two numbers are 12 and 21, and the square root of their sum is 14.

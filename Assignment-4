Aptitude Assignment 4

1.	A leak in the bottom of a tank can empty the full tank in 6 hours. An inlet pipe fills water at the rate of 4 litres per minute. When the tank is full, the inlet is opened, and due to the leak, the tank is empty in 8 hours. Find the capacity of the tank.

Sure. Here are the steps to solve the problem:
•	Rate of leakage = 1 tank / 6 hours = 1/6 tank/hour
•	Rate of filling = 4 liters/minute = 240 liters/hour
•	Net rate = Rate of filling - Rate of leakage = 240 liters/hour - 1/6 tank/hour = 239.23 liters/hour
•	Capacity = Net rate * Time = 239.23 liters/hour * 8 hours = 1914.84 liters
Therefore, the capacity of the tank is 1914.84 liters.
2.	Of the 1000 inhabitants in a town, 60% are males, 20% are literate. If 25% of all the inhabitants 25%, are literate, then what percentage of females are literate?

Sure, I can help you with that.
Here's the solution:
Number of males in the town = 60/100 * 1000 = 600
Number of females in the town = 1000 - 600 = 400
Number of literate people in the town = 25/100 * 1000 = 250
Number of literate males in the town = 20/100 * 600 = 120
Number of literate females in the town = 250 - 120 = 130
Percentage of females who are literate in the town = 130/400 * 100 = 32.5%
Therefore, 32.5% of the females in the town are literate.

3.	In an examination 80% candidates passed in English and 85% candidates passed in Mathematics. If 73% of candidates passed in both these subjects, what percent of candidates failed in both the subjects?

Sure, I can help you with that.
Here's the solution:
Percentage of candidates who passed English = 80%
Percentage of candidates who passed Mathematics = 85%
Percentage of candidates who passed in both English and Mathematics = 73%

Percentage of candidates who passed at least one subject = 80% + 85% - 73% = 92%

Percentage of candidates who failed in both subjects = 100% - 92% = 8%
Therefore, 8% of candidates failed in both subjects.
4.	The monthly income of a person is 13,500, and his monthly expenditure is 9,000. Next year's income increased by 14%, and his expenditure increased by 7%. Find percent increase in his savings is?

The person's monthly income next year is 13500 * 1.14 = 15,490. 
His monthly expenditure next year is 9000 * 1.07 = 9,630. 
His monthly savings next year is 15,490 - 9,630 = 5,860. 
His monthly savings increased by 5,860 - 4,500 = 1,360. 
The percentage increase in his savings is 1,360 / 4,500 * 100 = 30%. 
So the answer is 30.

5.	49 pumps can empty a tank in 10 days, working 10 hours a day. if 70 pumps are used for 7 hours each day then in how many days the tank can be emptied?

The number of pumps is directly proportional to the number of hours worked and inversely proportional to the number of days.
So,
 (number of pumps) * (number of hours worked) = (number of days) * constant
For 49 pumps, 10 hours a day, and 10 days, the constant is:
 (49) * (10) = (10) * constant

constant = 490
For 70 pumps, 7 hours a day, and x days, the equation is:
 (70) * (7) = (x) * 490

x = 70/7 * 490/70
x = 7
Therefore, it will take 7 days to empty the tank with 70 pumps working 7 hours a day.
